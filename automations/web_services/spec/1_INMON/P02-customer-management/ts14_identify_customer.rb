And as soon as 4.6.1 was out we started working on 4.6.2, which will be released a few weeks from now. The next big thing, but also the next thing We have started development on the next big release, with more REST testing improvements. We have reinforced the team, and now we are splitting it into two: a smaller team focused on 4.6.2 and a larger team focusing on the next big release Better personas We have invested a lot of time in creating personas to represent our users, and we are continuing to work with them. A lot. For us, the purpose of personas is to help us focus our user stories. We want to make sure our user stories match the personasÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ goals. This quickly puts an end to disagreements we might have while developing a certain feature. When we add the perspective of a certain persona it often becomes obvious which solution of a certain user story is the most appropriate. So learning about our users as to improve personas is an important task for us. When we meet real users and talk about the problems they face, it becomes important input for developing our personas. Error driven development Last week I was in Berlin to visit the Agile Testing Days conference where I did a small talk on focusing much more on preparing for error handling than you normally do when writing code. Surprisingly, there was a lot of interest, and I hopefully planted some ideas into peopleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s minds that will help in creating better quality software. DonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t forget; itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s not only about the tools, you also have to know what to do with them. Suggestions needed I received some really good feature suggestions during my short visit to the Agile Testing Days, and also on the SoapUI forums. But I always need more. Please let me know about the features you need, and the problems youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re having when testing. Go to the forums nd make yourself heard. Thanks!'
